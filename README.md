## Code Style guidelines ##

### File Name ###
Must be all lowercase and may include underscores (_) or dashes (-), but no additional punctuation. Filenames' extension must be .js.

### File Encoding ###
Source files are encoded in **UTF-8**.

### Block indentation ###

Each time a new block or block-like construct is opened, the indent increases by one **tab**. When the block ends, the indent returns to the previous indent level.

The indent level applies to both code and comments throughout the block.

### Braces ###

Braces follow the K&R style for _nonempty_ blocks and block-like constructs.

* No line break before the opening brace.
* Line break after the opening brace.
* Line break before the closing brace.
* Line break after the closing brace _if_ that brace terminates a statement or the body of a function or class statement or a class method. Specifically, there is **no** line break after the brace if it is followed by `else`, `catch`, `while`, or a comma, semicolon, or right-parenthesis.

### Statements ###

Semicolons are _required_. One line per statement.

### Line-wrapping ###

When line-wrapping, each line after the first (each _continuation line_) is indented at least +2 tabs from the original line, unless it falls under the rules of block indentation.
